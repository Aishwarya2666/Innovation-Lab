    <p>
      Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. It's also a plant
      (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The
      coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32
      feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in
      Ethiopia, and now also grow in South America, Central America and
      Southeast Asia. They are an important crop for the economies of many
      countries.☕✨

      A cappuccino is a beloved espresso-based hot coffee drink made with
      layering of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam on top. The taste of
      cappuccinos can be described as creamy, smooth, and balanced. The
      combination of flavors and textures creates a delightful and comforting
      experience for many coffee enthusiasts.
